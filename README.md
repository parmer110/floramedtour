### Distinctiveness and Complexity: 
    * Implemented encoding and decoding function. (For all 149186 Unicode characters avalibility in 26 english letters and 0 digits characters) and AES cryptography function with internal security-key and minimul string lenght.
    * Implementing "getter" and "setter" systems in database models get and save values for guarantee encoded data saved and decoded whats are get from DB.
    * Contains 8 applications.
    * Using postgreSQL database.
    * Contains commerce, messaging, todo list and ... units, Django backend and Javascript frontend.
    * Using memory maintenance management systems as "Lazy Loading", "Mamory Caching" or "Prefetching".
    * Common application within main 7 applications, contains "utils" package for common functions and classes which I have wroted.
### Files content:
    * crypto, (common/utils/crypto.py): encryption functions and decryption ones.
### Running:
    * python manage.py runserver.
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
1. settings.py managed: 
    * 6 applications definition:
        - food
        - nursing
        - shopping
        - stay
        - tourism
        - transportation
        - treatment
    * Database defined as postgresql
    * Caching models function in memory.

### Notes:
1- Create base classes in the "common" application.
